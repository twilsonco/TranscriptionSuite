## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Features

- **100% Local**: *Everything* runs on your own computer, the app doesn't need internet beyond the initial setup*
- **Multiple Models available**: *WhisperX* (all three sizes of the [`faster-whisper`](https://huggingface.co/Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3) models), NVIDIA NeMo [*Parakeet v3*](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3)/[*Canary v2*](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/canary-1b-v2), and [*VibeVoice-ASR*](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR) models are supported
- **Speaker Diarization**: Speaker identification & diarization (subtitling) for all three model families; Whisper and Nemo use PyAnnote for diarization while VibeVoice does it by itself
- **Parallel Processing**: If your VRAM budget allows it, transcribe & diarize a recording at the same time - speeding up processing time significantly
- **Truly Multilingual**: Whisper supports [90+ languages](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py); NeMo Parakeet/Canary support [25 European languages](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3); VibeVoice supports [50 languages](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/VibeVoice-ASR)
- **Longform Transcription**: Record as long as you want and have it transcribed in seconds; either using your mic or the system audio
- **Session File Import**: Import existing audio files from the Session tab; transcription results are saved directly as `.txt` or `.srt` to a folder of your choice — no Notebook entry created
- **Live Mode**: Real-time sentence-by-sentence transcription for continuous dictation workflows (Whisper-only currently)
- **Global Keyboard Shortcuts**: System-wide shortcuts & paste-at-cursor functionality
- **Remote Access**: Securely access your desktop at home running the model from anywhere
  (utilizing Tailscale) or share it on your local network via LAN
- **Audio Notebook**: An Audio Notebook mode, with a calendar-based view,
  full-text search, and LM Studio integration (chat with the AI about your notes)

📌*Half an hour of audio transcribed in under a minute with Whisper (RTX 3060)!*

**All transcription processing runs entirely on your own computer — your audio never leaves your machine. Internet is only needed to download model weights on first use (STT models, PyAnnote diarization, and wav2vec2 alignment models); all weights are cached locally in a Docker volume and no further internet access is required after that.*

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Prerequisites

To begin with, you need to install Docker (or Podman).

> *Both are supported; the dashboard and shell scripts auto-detect which runtime is available (Docker is checked first, then Podman).*

**Linux (Docker):**

1. Install Docker Engine
   - For Arch run `sudo pacman -S --needed docker`
   - For other distros refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. Add your user to the `docker` group so the app can talk to Docker without `sudo`:

    ```bash
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```

    Then **log out and back in** (or reboot) for the change to take effect.
3. Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit (for GPU mode)
   - Refer to the [NVIDIA documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
   - Not required if using CPU mode

**Linux (Podman):**

1. Install Podman (4.7+ required for `podman compose` support)
   - For Arch run `sudo pacman -S --needed podman`
   - For Fedora/RHEL: Podman is pre-installed
   - For other distros refer to the [Podman documentation](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
2. For GPU mode, configure CDI (Container Device Interface):

    ```bash
    sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
    ```

   - Requires nvidia-container-toolkit 1.14+
   - Not required if using CPU mode

**Windows:**

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) with WSL2 backen (during installation, if presented with the option, make sure the *'Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V'* checkbox is enabled).
After installation to make sure it's enabled, run `wsl --list --verbose` - if the number is 2, Docker is using the WSL 2 backend.
2. Install NVIDIA GPU driver with WSL support (standard NVIDIA gaming drivers work fine)
   - Not required if using CPU mode

**macOS:**

> **Two server modes are available on macOS. Choose one:**

*Option A — Bare-Metal / Metal (Apple Silicon, recommended):*

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if not already present
2. Install Python 3.13 and `uv`:

    ```bash
    brew install python@3.13
    brew install uv
    ```

3. Install FFmpeg (required for audio processing):

    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

4. See **[Section 2.4](#24-macos-bare-metal-setup-apple-silicon)** to complete the server setup.

> Metal / MLX acceleration gives ~3 s transcription per minute of audio on M-series chips.

*Option B — Docker / CPU mode:*

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)
2. GPU acceleration is not available inside Docker on macOS — the server runs in CPU mode
3. Follow Sections 2.2–2.3 as normal

### 2.2 Download the Dashboard app

Before doing anything else, you need to download the Dashboard app for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/homelab-00/TranscriptionSuite/releases) page.
This is just the frontend, no models or packages are downloaded yet.

>- *Linux and Windows builds are x64; macOS is arm64*
>- *Each release artifact includes an gpg signature by my key (`.sig`)*

#### 2.2.1 Linux AppImage Prerequisites

AppImages require **FUSE 2** (`libfuse.so.2`), which is not installed by default on distros that ship with GNOME (both Fedora & Arch KDE worked fine out of the box). If you see `dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2`, install the appropriate package:

| Distribution | Package | Install Command |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian | `libfuse2` | `sudo apt install libfuse2` |
| Ubuntu 24.04+ | `libfuse2t64` | `sudo apt install libfuse2t64` |
| Fedora | `fuse-libs` | `sudo dnf install fuse-libs` |
| Arch Linux | `fuse2` | `sudo pacman -S fuse2` |

> **Sandbox note:** The AppImage automatically disables Chromium's SUID sandbox
> (`--no-sandbox`) since the AppImage squashfs mount cannot satisfy its permission
> requirements. This is the standard approach for Electron-based AppImages and does
> not affect application security.

##### 2.2.2 Verify Download with Kleopatra (optional)

1. Download both files from the same release:
   - installer/app (`.AppImage`, `.exe` or `.dmg`)
   - matching signature file (`.sig`)
2. Install Kleopatra: <https://apps.kde.org/kleopatra/>
3. Import the public key in Kleopatra from this repository:
   - [`docs/assets/homelab-00_0xBFE4CC5D72020691_public.asc`](assets/homelab-00_0xBFE4CC5D72020691_public.asc)
4. In Kleopatra, use `File` -> `Decrypt/Verify Files...` and select the downloaded `.asc` signature.
5. If prompted, select the corresponding downloaded app file. Verification should report a valid signature.

### 2.3 Setting Up the Server (Docker)

> **macOS users:** If you are using the bare-metal/Metal mode, skip this section and go to **[Section 2.4](#24-macos-bare-metal-setup-apple-silicon)**.

We're now ready to start the server. This process includes two parts: downloading the Docker image and starting a Docker container based off of that image.

1. *Download the image*: Using the Sidebar on the left, head over to the Server tab and click the button 'Fetch Fresh Image'
2. *Starting the container*: Scroll down a bit and click the 'Start Local' button in the #2 box
3. *Initial setup - models, diarization*: A series of prompts will ask you for which models you want to download to begin with, and if you want to enable diarization. Specifically for diarization, you need to enter your HuggingFace token and accept the [terms of the model](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1). To create that token, see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) for instructions and then create a 'Read' access token.
4. **Wait** - Initial startup can take a long time, even on newer hardware and fast internet speeds; we're talking 10-20 minutes with reasonable specs though, not hours; you'll know it's done when the server status light turns green
5. **Start the client**: Head to the Session tab and click on the 'Start Local' button inside the Client Link box - if it turns green you're ready to roll!

<br>

Notes:

- *Settings are saved to (Docker / Electron app):*
  - *- Linux: `~/.config/TranscriptionSuite/`*
  - *- Windows: `%APPDATA%\TranscriptionSuite\`*
  - *- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/`*

- *GNOME note: The [AppIndicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) extension is required for system tray support.*

- *Docker vs Podman:*
*TranscriptionSuite supports both Docker and Podman. The dashboard and CLI scripts auto-detect which runtime is available. For GPU mode with Podman, ensure CDI is configured (`sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml`).*
*Podman 4.7+ is required for `podman compose` support.*

### 2.4 macOS Bare-Metal Setup (Apple Silicon)

> Runs the server **natively** on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) with Metal GPU acceleration for both transcription (MLX Whisper) and diarization (PyAnnote via MPS). Skips Docker entirely — no container, no CPU-only limitation.
>
> **Prerequisites:** Python 3.13, `uv`, and `ffmpeg` — see [Section 2.1](#21-prerequisites) → *Option A*.

#### Step 1 — Set up the Python environment

```bash
cd /path/to/TranscriptionSuite/server/backend

# Core install + MLX Whisper (Metal-accelerated transcription)
uv sync --extra mlx

# Optional: also install Opus support for the Omi WebSocket endpoint
#   (requires: brew install opus)
# uv sync --extra mlx --extra omi
```

#### Step 2 — Prepare data directories

The server creates all required subdirectories automatically on first startup. The paths used by the bare-metal server on macOS are:

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Database, audio files, tokens, logs | `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/data/` |
| HuggingFace model weights | `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/models/` |
| Server user config (optional) | `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/config.yaml` |
| Dashboard settings | `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/` |

To pre-create them (optional — the server will create them if they don't exist):

```bash
DATA="$HOME/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite"
mkdir -p "$DATA/data/database" "$DATA/data/audio" "$DATA/data/logs" \
         "$DATA/data/tokens" "$DATA/models"
```

#### Step 3 — (Optional) Customize server config

On macOS the server loads its user config from `~/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/config.yaml`. Copy the default and edit it to suit your setup:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite"
cp server/config.yaml "$HOME/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/config.yaml"
```

Key settings for bare-metal macOS:

```yaml
main_transcriber:
  model: "mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-mlx"  # Metal-accelerated

diarization:
  device: "auto"   # auto-selects MPS (Metal) on Apple Silicon
  model: "pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1"
  hf_token: null   # or set your HuggingFace token here
```

#### Step 4 — Start the server

```bash
cd /path/to/TranscriptionSuite

DATA="$HOME/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite"
DATA_DIR="$DATA/data" \
HF_HOME="$DATA/models" \
HF_TOKEN="hf_..." \
MAIN_TRANSCRIBER_MODEL="mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-mlx" \
server/backend/.venv/bin/uvicorn server.api.main:app \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9786
```

> **Note:** Set `DATA` as a shell variable first to avoid issues with the space in `Application Support`. Do **not** quote-expand `$HOME` inside the env-var assignment lines themselves — assign `DATA` first, as shown above.

Verify the server is ready:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9786/ready | python3 -m json.tool
```

A healthy response shows `"loaded": true` with `"backend": "mlx_whisper"` and `"features.mlx.available": true`.

To add debug logging, include these env vars in the startup block:

```bash
LOG_LEVEL="DEBUG" \
LOG_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/TranscriptionSuite/data/logs" \
```

#### Step 5 — Connect the dashboard

1. Download the macOS dashboard app (arm64) from the [Releases](https://github.com/homelab-00/TranscriptionSuite/releases) page, *or* run in dev mode (see [README_DEV.md](README_DEV.md))
2. Open the dashboard — it should auto-connect to the local server on port 9786
3. Go to **Settings** → **Runtime Profile** → select **Metal (Apple Silicon)**
4. Navigate to the **Session** tab and click **Start Local** — the status light should turn green

#### Diarization setup

Speaker diarization uses PyAnnote and runs on Metal (MPS) automatically. You need a HuggingFace token and must accept the [model terms](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1):

1. Create a **Read** token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
2. Accept the model terms at the link above
3. Pass the token via `HF_TOKEN="hf_..."` in the startup command (or set `diarization.hf_token` in your `config.yaml`)
4. On first use the diarization model (~1 GB) is downloaded and cached to `HF_HOME`

#### For more detail

See **[docs/apple-silicon-metal.md](apple-silicon-metal.md)** for MLX backend notes, Omi WebSocket setup, logging configuration, and curl command examples.

## 3. Remote Connection

TranscriptionSuite supports remote transcription where a **server machine** (with a
GPU) runs the Docker container and a **client machine** connects to it via the
Dashboard app. Two connection profiles are available:

| Profile | Use Case | Network Requirement |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| **Tailscale** | Cross-network / internet (recommended) | Both machines on the same [Tailnet](https://tailscale.com/) |
| **LAN** | Same local network, no Tailscale needed | Both machines on the same LAN / subnet |

Both profiles use **HTTPS + token authentication**. The only difference is *how* the
client reaches the server and *where* the TLS certificates come from.

**Architecture overview:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────┐         HTTPS (port 9786)        ┌─────────────────────────┐
│      Server Machine     │◄────────────────────────────────►│      Client Machine     │
│                         │         + Auth Token             │                         │
│  • Runs the Dashboard   │                                  │  • Runs the Dashboard   │
│  • Clicks "Start Remote"│         Tailscale Tunnel         │  • Settings → Client →  │
│  • Has TLS certificates │         ── or ──                 │    "Use remote server"  │
│  • Has the GPU          │         LAN connection           │  • No GPU needed        │
└─────────────────────────┘                                  └─────────────────────────┘
```

**Security model:**

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **Tailscale Network** *(Tailscale profile)* | Only devices on your Tailnet can reach the server |
| **TLS/HTTPS** | All traffic encrypted with certificates |
| **Token Authentication** | Required for all API requests in remote mode |

### 3.1 Option A: Tailscale (recommended)

Use this when the server and client are on **different networks** (e.g., home
server ↔ work laptop), or when you want Tailscale's zero-config networking
and automatic DNS.

#### Server Machine Setup

**Step 1 — Install & Authenticate Tailscale**

1. Install Tailscale: [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
2. Authenticate: `sudo tailscale up` (Linux) or via the Tailscale app (Windows/macOS)
3. Go to [Tailscale Admin Console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin) → **DNS** tab
4. Enable **MagicDNS** and **HTTPS Certificates**

Your DNS settings should look like this:

![Tailscale DNS Settings](assets/tailscale-dns-settings.png)

**Step 2 — Generate TLS Certificates** *(server machine only)*

```bash
# Replace with your actual machine name + tailnet
sudo tailscale cert your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net
```

This produces two files: `your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt` and
`your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key`. Move and rename them to the standard
location so the app can find them without config changes:

*(To change the default location, edit `remote_server.tls.host_cert_path` and
`host_key_path` in `config.yaml`.)*

**Linux:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/Tailscale
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.crt
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.*
chmod 600 ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
mkdir "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale" -Force
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale\my-machine.crt"
mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\Tailscale\my-machine.key"
```

For Windows, also update the certificate paths in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
remote_server:
  tls:
    host_cert_path: "~/Documents/Tailscale/my-machine.crt"
    host_key_path: "~/Documents/Tailscale/my-machine.key"
```

> **Note:** Tailscale HTTPS certificates are issued for `.ts.net` hostnames, so
> MagicDNS must be enabled in your Tailnet.
>
> **Certificate expiry:** These certificates expire after **90 days**. When they expire the app will attempt to auto-renew via `tailscale cert` before starting the server. If auto-renewal fails, renew manually:
>
> ```bash
> sudo tailscale cert your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net
> mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.crt ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.crt
> mv your-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net.key ~/.config/Tailscale/my-machine.key
> ```

**Step 3 — Start the Server in Remote Mode**

1. Open the Dashboard on the server machine
2. Navigate to the **Server** view
3. Click **Start Remote**
4. Wait for the container to become healthy (green status)

On the first remote start, an admin **auth token** is generated automatically.
You can find it in the Server view's "Auth Token" field, or in the container logs:

```bash
docker compose logs | grep "Admin Token:"
```

Copy this token — you'll need it on the client machine.

> **Tailscale hostname:** Once the server is running, the Server view displays the
> machine's Tailscale FQDN (e.g., `desktop.tail1234.ts.net`) with a copy button.
> Use this exact hostname when configuring clients — don't enter just the tailnet
> suffix (e.g., `tail1234.ts.net`).

**Step 4 — Open the Firewall Port (Linux)**

If the server machine runs a firewall, port 9786 must be open for
remote clients to reach the server. Without this, connections silently time out.

| Distribution | Command |
|---|---|
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (`ufw`) | `sudo ufw allow 9786/tcp comment 'TranscriptionSuite Server'` |
| **Fedora GNOME / Fedora KDE** (`firewalld`) | `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9786/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload` |

The dashboard will show a firewall warning banner on the Server view if it
detects the port may be blocked.

> **Note:** This step is only needed on Linux with an active firewall. Windows and
> macOS do not typically block Docker ports by default.

#### Client Machine Setup

1. Install Tailscale on the client machine and sign in with the **same account**
   as the server machine (so both devices are on the same Tailnet)
2. Open the Dashboard on the client machine
3. Go to **Settings** → **Client** tab
4. Enable **"Use remote server instead of local"**
5. Select **Tailscale** as the remote profile
6. Enter the server's **full Tailscale hostname** in the host field
   (e.g., `my-machine.tail1234.ts.net`) — copy it from the Server view on the
   server machine
7. Set port to **`9786`**
8. **Use HTTPS** will be automatically enabled
9. Paste the **auth token** from the server into the Auth Token field
10. Close the Settings modal — the client now connects to the remote server

> **Tip:** The client machine does *not* need certificates, Docker, or a GPU.
> It only needs Tailscale running and a valid auth token.
>
> **Common mistake:** Enter the **full machine hostname** (e.g.,
> `desktop.tail1234.ts.net`), not just the tailnet name (`tail1234.ts.net`).
> The Settings modal will warn you if it detects a bare tailnet name without a
> machine prefix.

### 3.2 Option B: LAN (same local network)

Use this when both machines are on the **same local network** and you don't want
to use Tailscale. This is common for home-lab setups or office environments.

LAN mode uses the same HTTPS + token authentication as Tailscale mode — the only
differences are the hostname (LAN IP or local DNS name instead of a `.ts.net`
address) and the certificate source (self-signed, local CA, or other locally
trusted certificate instead of a Tailscale-issued one).

#### Server Machine Setup

**Step 1 — TLS Certificate**

LAN mode requires a TLS certificate. The dashboard **auto-generates** a
self-signed certificate on the first remote start if none exists, covering
`localhost` and all detected LAN IP addresses. No manual steps are needed in
most cases.

> **Custom certificate (optional):** If you prefer to use your own certificate
> (e.g., from an internal CA), place it at the paths in `config.yaml` under
> `remote_server.tls.lan_host_cert_path` / `lan_host_key_path`
> (defaults: `~/.config/TranscriptionSuite/lan-server.crt` / `.key` on Linux,
> `~/Documents/TranscriptionSuite/lan-server.crt` / `.key` on Windows).

**Step 2 — Start the Server in Remote Mode**

Same as Tailscale above:

1. Open the Dashboard, go to **Server** view, click **Start Remote**
2. Copy the auth token once the container is healthy

**Step 3 — Open the Firewall Port (Linux)**

Same as Tailscale above — if a firewall is active:

| Distribution | Command |
|---|---|
| **Ubuntu / Debian** (`ufw`) | `sudo ufw allow 9786/tcp` |
| **Fedora GNOME / Fedora KDE** (`firewalld`) | `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=9786/tcp && sudo firewall-cmd --reload` |

#### Client Machine Setup

1. Open the Dashboard on the client machine
2. Go to **Settings** → **Client** tab
3. Enable **"Use remote server instead of local"**
4. Select **LAN** as the remote profile
5. Enter the server's **LAN IP or hostname** (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
6. Set port to **`9786`**
7. **Use HTTPS** will be automatically enabled
8. Paste the **auth token** from the server
9. Close Settings — the client now connects over your local network

> **Note on Kubernetes / custom deployments:** If you run the server container
> directly (e.g., via Kubernetes or your own Docker setup), you can still use the
> LAN profile on the client. Just point the LAN host at your load balancer or
> service IP. The server image is available at
> `ghcr.io/homelab-00/transcriptionsuite-server`. Ensure `TLS_ENABLED=true` and
> the certificate/key are mounted at `/certs/cert.crt` and `/certs/cert.key`
> inside the container.

## 4. OpenAI-compatible API Endpoints

Mounted at `/v1/audio/`. These endpoints follow the [OpenAI Audio API spec](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio) so that OpenAI-compatible clients (Open-WebUI, LM Studio, etc.) can point at TranscriptionSuite as a drop-in STT backend.

**Auth:** Same rules as all other API routes — Bearer token required in TLS mode; open to localhost in local mode.

**Error shape:** All errors follow the OpenAI error envelope:

```json
{"error": {"message": "...", "type": "...", "param": null, "code": null}}
```

### `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`

Transcribe an audio or video file. Language auto-detected when `language` is omitted.

**Form fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `UploadFile` | required | Audio or video file |
| `model` | `string` | `"whisper-1"` | Accepted but ignored; the server uses whatever model is configured |
| `language` | `string` | auto-detect | BCP-47 language code (e.g. `en`, `fr`) |
| `prompt` | `string` | `null` | Initial prompt passed to the transcription engine as `initial_prompt` |
| `response_format` | `string` | `"json"` | One of `json`, `text`, `verbose_json`, `srt`, `vtt` |
| `temperature` | `float` | `null` | Accepted but ignored |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `list[string]` | `null` | Include `"word"` to enable word-level timestamps (only effective with `verbose_json`) |

**Response formats:**

| `response_format` | Content-Type | Shape |
|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| `json` | `application/json` | `{"text": "..."}` |
| `text` | `text/plain` | Raw transcript string |
| `verbose_json` | `application/json` | Full object with `task`, `language`, `duration`, `text`, `segments`, optional `words` |
| `srt` | `text/plain` | SRT subtitle file |
| `vtt` | `text/plain` | WebVTT subtitle file |

**Error codes:**

| Status | `type` | Cause |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `400` | `invalid_request_error` | Unknown `response_format`, missing/empty `file` |
| `429` | `rate_limit_error` | Another transcription job is already running |
| `503` | `server_error` | No transcription model is configured |
| `500` | `server_error` | Internal engine error |

**Example (curl):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@recording.wav" \
  -F "model=whisper-1" \
  -F "response_format=verbose_json" \
  -F "timestamp_granularities[]=word"
```

#### `POST /v1/audio/translations`

Transcribe **and translate** an audio or video file to English. Identical to `/transcriptions` except:

- `language` is not accepted (source language is always auto-detected)
- Translation target is always English
- The `task` field in `verbose_json` responses is `"translate"` instead of `"transcribe"`

**Form fields:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | `UploadFile` | required | Audio or video file |
| `model` | `string` | `"whisper-1"` | Accepted but ignored |
| `prompt` | `string` | `null` | Initial prompt passed to the transcription engine |
| `response_format` | `string` | `"json"` | One of `json`, `text`, `verbose_json`, `srt`, `vtt` |
| `temperature` | `float` | `null` | Accepted but ignored |
| `timestamp_granularities[]` | `list[string]` | `null` | Include `"word"` to enable word-level timestamps |

**Error codes:** Same as `/transcriptions`.

> **Backend note:** Translation requires a Whisper-family model with translation capability. Parakeet/Canary backends that don't support `task="translate"` will return a `400` or `500` from the engine layer.

**Example (curl):**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9786/v1/audio/translations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -F "file=@foreign_audio.mp3" \
  -F "response_format=text"
```

## 5. Troubleshooting

As with most things, the first thing to try is turning them off and on again. Stop the server/client, quit the app and then try again.

The next step is to start deleting things. The safest choice is deleting *everything*, but that means having to redownload everything and losing whatever recordings you've saved in the Notebook (unless you create a backup). Volumes 'data' & 'models' don't usually need to be removed for example.

Controls for all these actions can be found in the Server tab. Here you can remove the container, image, and volumes individually or use the big red button at the bottom (that can also remove your config folder).

### GPU not working after a system update (Linux)

If the server crashes with `CUDA failed with error unknown error` after a system update (common on rolling-release distros like Arch), your NVIDIA driver likely updated past what the legacy Docker GPU hook supports. The fix is to switch to CDI mode:

```bash
sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate --output=/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml
sudo nvidia-ctk config --in-place --set nvidia-container-runtime.mode=cdi
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

The dashboard detects CDI automatically and uses the correct GPU configuration. No image rebuild or reinstall needed.

## 8. State of the Project

### 8.1 In General & AI Disclosure

This was initially developed as a personal tool and in time turned into a hobby project. I am an engineer, just not a *software* engineer; so **this whole thing is vibecoded**. At the same time it's not blind vibecoding; for example Dockerizing the server for easy distribution was 100% my idea.

I'm using this project to learn about programming. Starting from virtually nothing, I can now say that I've got a decent grasp of Python, git, uv & Docker. I started doing this because it's fun, not to make money. Though I do find, despite my mech eng degree, that I want to follow it as a career.

Anyways, since I'm 100% dogfooding the app I'm not going to abandon it (unless some other project makes mine completely redundant). I will also try to the best of my ability to deal with bugs as soon as possible.

Finally, I want to thank [RealtimeSTT](https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT) for inspiring this project.

### 8.2 Contributing

I'm always open to contributors! Might help me learn a thing or two about programming.

To follow the progress of issues and planned features, head over to the project's [Blackboard](https://github.com/users/homelab-00/projects/2/views/2). Pick a planned feature to work on or add your own suggestion.
